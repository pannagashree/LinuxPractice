textX.txt are files with file holes created by fileHole.c,
where X can take values 1, 2, 3,...
and it represents that there are X chucks of file holes 
each of size FILEHOLE_SIZE (defined in the code),
between 2 chucks of data.


Compile mycp1.c with -D_GNU_SOURCE option for gcc.
Because it uses lseek's SEEK_DATA which will be
visible from stdio.h only when _GNU_SOURCE macro 
is enabled.
